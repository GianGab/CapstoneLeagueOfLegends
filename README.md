# CapstoneLeagueOfLegends   
   
My capstone project was my final project for my data science academy with DigitalFutures!   

**CONTEXT** - In my experience, people in league of legends give up way too quickly! Since emotional reasoning never worked, why not create a means for 
statistical reasoning?   

**CONTENTS** -
In this project I explore models that (for my current knowledge and skill level at the time) best predict the chances of winning the game at a given point in time.
This ended up being a logistic regression model.   
I also
produce a user input that:    
**1)** tells you that your chances of winning are still pretty high if the calculated probability was above ~60% ish     
**2)** provides encouraging words for anyone whose chances of winning are pretty slim
