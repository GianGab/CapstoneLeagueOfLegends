# CapstoneLeagueOfLegends ![logo-1200-589b3ef693ce8a750fa4b4704f1e61f2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120195693/216154658-4efdf76f-e58e-4468-bcd6-205971240c17.png)
  
   
My final project for my data science academy with DigitalFutures!   

**Context** - In my experience, people in league of legends give up way too quickly! Since emotional reasoning never worked, why not create a means for 
statistical reasoning?   

**Contents** -
In this project I explore models that (for my current knowledge and skill level at the time) best predict the chances of winning the game at a given point in time.
This ended up being a logistic regression model.   
I also
produce a user input that:    
**1)** tells you that your chances of winning are still pretty high if the calculated probability was above ~60% ish     
**2)** provides encouraging words for anyone whose chances of winning are pretty slim
   
**Final comments** - this was a tricky project mostly with the data cleaning bits. I only really knew to use RegEx to do a bunch of the filtering out characters and features etc. But it was a super fun project nevertheless.
